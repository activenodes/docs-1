#### 1) Go to [keplr.app](https://www.keplr.app/) and select "Install Keplr for Chrome."

> Keplr is an interchain, IBC-enabled wallet, which means it can also serve as your wallet for several other blockchains in the Cosmos ecosystem and beyond.

#### 4) Select if you’d prefer a 12 or 24 word secret recovery phrase, and write it down.

> It's very important that you safely store and never share your secret recovery phrase! This is the only backup to your wallet in the event your device is lost or destroyed. Failure to properly store and conceal your secret recovery phrase will most likely result in the loss of assets stored in your wallet.

#### 5) Create a name and password for your wallet, then click “Next.”
