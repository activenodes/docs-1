# Funding a Wallet

![](/bg/funding-a-wallet.png)

> Purchasing and withdrawing ATOM, the native Cosmos Hub token, is one of the easiest ways to start using Umee and the rest of the [Cosmos ecosystem](/users/blockchai-basics/what-is-cosmos). ATOM can easily be [exchanged for native UMEE tokens](/users/getting-started/funding-wallet.html#trading-cosmos-assets-on-a-decentralized-exchange) needed to transact on Umee.

#### 1) Select the "Withdraw" option for the ATOM token on your centralized exchange of choice.

> You can also choose to withdraw other Cosmos assets supported by your exchange, like the [UMEE token](/overview/umee-token).

#### 2) Copy your Cosmos wallet address found under the "Cosmos Hub" network in your [Umee blockchain compatible wallet](/users/getting-started/creating-wallet.html#creating-an-umee-blockchain-compatible-wallet), and paste it in the "Send to" section.

> If you're withdrawing a different Cosmos asset like the [UMEE token](/overview/umee-token) you will need to [choose the appropriate network before copying your wallet address](/users/getting-started/using-wallet.html#copying-a-wallet-address).

#### 3) Select withdraw, approve the withdrawal, and wait for the transaction to process. Your ATOM will appear on the _Cosmos Hub network_ in your Umee blockchain compatible wallet shortly.

#### Once you have received the ATOM on the Cosmos Hub network in your Umee blockchain compatible wallet you can:

* [Transfer it to a decentralized exchange to trade it for other assets like UMEE](/users/getting-started/funding-wallet.html#trading-cosmos-assets-on-a-decentralized-exchange)
* [Transfer it to the Umee blockchain](/users/using-the-web-app/transferring-tokens) to [supply on the Umee market](/users/using-the-web-app/supply-withdraw) and start earning supply yield

## Transferring Cosmos Assets to Umee

> Since Umee is a base layer blockchain assets need to be transferred on to Umee before they can be [supplied on the Umee Market](/users/using-the-web-app/supply-withdraw).

#### 1) Connect your Umee wallet to the [Umee web app](https://app.umee.cc/).

#### 2) On the "Markets" page, select "Cosmos."

> When "Cosmos" is selected tokens will be transferred between their native chains and the Umee blockchain, with the exception of native UMEE tokens which are already on the Umee blockchain.

#### 3) Identify which asset you’d like to transfer on to Umee and select “Transfer” in the appropriate row.

![For this example we will be transferring ATOM from the Cosmos Hub.](/bg/ibc-2.png)

#### 4) Select which network you'd like to transfer _**to**_ on the top of the pop-up.

> To transfer assets off of Umee and back to their native chain, simply select the destination chain here.

![We will be selecting "UMEE" since we are transferring ATOM onto the Umee blockchain.](/bg/ibc-3.png)

#### 5) In the pop-up, input the amount of tokens you’d like to transfer, select “Transfer,” and approve the transaction in your wallet.
