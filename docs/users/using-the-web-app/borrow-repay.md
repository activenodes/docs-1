#### 1) Select the "Dashboard" section on the navigation bar.

#### 2) At the bottom right of the screen in the "Borrow" section, select the asset you’d like to borrow from the Umee market from the "Available Markets" list.

> To decrease your risk of [liquidation](/learn-the-basics/umee-basics/common-terms.html#liquidation), avoid using a large percentage of your [borrow limit](/learn-the-basics/umee-basics/common-terms.html#borrow-limit).

#### You have now borrowed an asset from the Umee market! Check out the Dashboard to monitor the health of your position to avoid being liquidated.

> Borrowers can decrease their chances of [liquidation](/learn-the-basics/umee-basics/common-terms.html#liquidation) by doing things like:
> * Borrowing smaller amounts relative to the [collateral](/learn-the-basics/umee-basics/common-terms.html#collateral) provided
> * Depositing more collateral as a borrow position gets closer to the [liquidation threshold](/learn-the-basics/umee-basics/common-terms.html#liquidation-threshold)
> * Repaying part or all of a loan when the position becomes unhealthy
