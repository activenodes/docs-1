> Umee supports lending and borrowing on the Umee and Ethereum networks, and plans to support several other chains in the future.

## Cosmos Transfers

> If you have [Cosmos](/learn-the-basics/cosmos-basics/what-is-cosmos) assets like ATOM on a different network in your [Umee blockchain compatible wallet](/users/getting-started/creating-wallet), follow this guide to transfer them to Umee.

#### 1) Make sure your [Umee wallet](/users/getting-started/creating-wallet.html#creating-an-umee-blockchain-compatible-wallet) and the wallet you're transferring from are [connected to the web app](/users/using-the-web-app/connecting-app).

#### 2) On the "Markets" page, select "Cosmos."

> When "Cosmos" is selected tokens will be transferred between their native chains and the Umee blockchain, with the exception of native UMEE tokens which are already on the Umee blockchain.

#### 3) Identify which asset you’d like to transfer on to Umee and select “Transfer” in the appropriate row.

![For this example we will be transferring ATOM from the Cosmos Hub.](/bg/ibc-2.png)

#### 4) Select which network you'd like to transfer _**to**_ on the top of the pop-up.

> To transfer assets off of Umee and back to their native chain, simply select the destination chain here.

![We will be selecting "UMEE" since we are transferring ATOM onto the Umee blockchain.](/bg/ibc-3.png)

#### 5) In the pop-up, input the amount of tokens you’d like to transfer, select “Transfer,” and approve the transaction in your wallet.

#### After tokens have been transferred to Umee, users can [supply them on the Umee market](/users/using-the-web-app/supply-withdraw) to start earning lending interest.

## Ethereum to Umee Transfers

> If you are in possession of [ERC-20 UMEE](/overview/umee-token/token-format), or if you'd like to access native Ethereum assets while enjoying Umee's fast and inexpensive transactions, use this guide to bridge ERC-20 assets to Umee.

> Ethereum -> Umee transfers require both an [Umee blockchain compatible wallet](/users/getting-started/creating-wallet) and an Ethereum wallet like MetaMask.

## Umee to Ethereum Transfers

> Umee -> Ethereum transfers require both an [Umee blockchain compatible wallet](/users/getting-started/creating-wallet) and an Ethereum wallet like MetaMask.

> Transactions on Ethereum may be significantly slower and more expensive than transactions on the Umee blockchain. Make sure you have an ETH balance in your Ethereum wallet before transferring tokens to Ethereum.
