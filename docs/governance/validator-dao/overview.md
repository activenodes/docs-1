# Validator DAO Overview

## Introduction

The Umee Validator DAO is proposed with the intention of further decentralizing decision making on all matters around the Umee [validators](/learn-the-basics/staking-basics/what-is-validator). The operations of the Umee Validator DAO will be fully led and run by the [Validator DAO Committee](/governance/validator-dao/the-committee) made up of volunteers from the Umee validator community. 

At its initial stage, the first and foremost responsibility of the DAO is Umee Foundation delegation decisions. Going forward, the Umee Core team will be taking a support role in optimizing and expanding the functions and impact of the Umee Validator DAO with the goal of building a successful, inclusive and sustainable validator community for Umee in the long run.

## How it Works

### Validators

****

Validators in the Umee ecosystem are encouraged to make contributions in exchange for a delegation from the Umee Foundation. Any validators who are interested in receiving an Umee Foundation delegation can submit a validator delegation application detailing the contributions they make. The Umee Foundation gives validator delegation on a quarterly basis. Such delegation decisions are made by the Umee Validator DAO Committee. 

> If you are a validator and wish to receive a delegation, [you can find the application details here](/governance/validator-dao/delegation-applications).

### Validator DAO Committee

****

The Umee Validator DAO is run and managed by the Umee Validator DAO Committee. The Umee Validator DAO Committee takes the responsibility of making delegation decisions each quarter. The Committee reviews the validators' delegation applications, evaluates each one's contributionss and makes delegation decisions as a group. 

Each quarter a new Umee Validator DAO Committee made up of 11 Umee validators will be formed on a first-come-first-served basis based on application submissions. Any validator can volunteer and become a committee member by submitting a Validator DAO Committee member application.
