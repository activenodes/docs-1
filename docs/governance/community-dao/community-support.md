# Community Support

> TLDR: Community Support leaders help organize, moderate, and support community members across all active Umee community channels.

> To get started as a community support leader visit the #start-here channel in the "Community DAO" section of [Umee's Discord](https://discord.gg/umee).

<br>

## Overview

Identify underserved platforms and create and lead regional Umee Community channels. Coordinate with other contributors to avoid unnecessary work - there is no need to volunteer as a moderator on channels that are already well-covered or channels that don't have an active community.

When submitting your work, providing a link to the community channel is enough - please don't link individual messages.

## Creating New Channels

### Requirements

****

- Communicate with your local community to ensure there is clear demand for the channel before creating it - only channels that are actively used can be considered valuable;
- Disclose that it is a community-run channel and include links to official channels;
- Appoint at least one other trusted community member as an admin so the account does not rely entirely on a single contributor;
- Use a unique password and require 2fa for any admins;
- Be respectful and avoid spamming existing channels in an effort to grow the channel;
- Follow Umee's [branding guidelines](https://umee.cc/brand/).

## Contribution Ideas

- Create and moderate regional community channels (e.g. an "Umee Spanish Community" Telegram channel) on regionally significant platforms as needed
- Translate important announcements and lead regional communities on [Umee's official Discord](https://discord.gg/umee)
- Help troubleshoot common issues on Discord and/or other community channels
- Create and distribute useful resources like infographics and tutorial gifs to help with troubleshooting 
- Lead productive conversations across community channels like Discord, Telegram, Reddit, and Commonwealth
