# Translators

> Translators are responsible for translating, organizing, and sharing official Umee content with the community members who need it.

<br>

## Overview

Work with others in your community to determine what needs to be translated, and where translated content should be organized. Present the content in a professional, well-organized, and easily accessible format. Once the content has been properly translated and published, work with regional [community support leaders](/governance/community-dao/community-support) to share the translations with users.
