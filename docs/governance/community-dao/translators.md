# Translators

> TLDR: Translators are responsible for translating, organizing, and sharing official Umee content with the community members who need it.

> To get started as an translator visit the #start-here channel in the "Community DAO" section of [Umee's Discord](https://discord.gg/umee).

<br>

## Overview

Work with others in your community to determine what needs to be translated, and where translated content should be organized. Present the content in a professional, well-organized, and easily accessible format. Once the content has been properly translated and published, work with regional [community support leaders](/governance/community-dao/community-support) to share the translations with users.

**[Medium](https://medium.com/)**

_Medium is likely the easiest platform to publish and organize professional looking translations of blog posts on. Medium publications can be used to allow multiple writers to contribute to the same blog to help stay organized. If a Medium publication is created, be sure to disclose that it is a community account used solely to translate official blog posts, and follow Umee's [branding guidelines](https://umee.cc/brand/)._

<br>

**[Notion](https://www.notion.so/product)**

_Notion is another organizational tool that can be used to share translated blog posts on. Try to choose a platform that other translators and readers will both prefer._
